# US-covid19-data-scraping
Extract and data from various states in the US related to COVID-19. We need the Python dependencies
```
fitz
PyMuPDF
pandas
pyjson
beautifulsoup4
requests
selenium
```

1. To extract and clean, run
```
make files
```
This will get you the latest data in `data/$DATE` and `pdfs/$DATE`.

2. To process, run
```
Rscript scripts/process.data.R
```
This will get you csv files for every state with variables *age*, *date*, *daily.deaths* and (state) *code* in `data/processed/$DATE/`.

3. To create figures, run
```
Rscript scripts/plot.comparison.and.timeseries.R
```
This will get you pdfs in `figures/$DATE/` of 
* Comparison between extracted data from the Department of Health and JHU overall deaths as well as,
* Time series of overall deaths for every state.


## PDF extractions
We use Requests to make HTTP/HTTPS requests to a web API, BeautifulSoup to extract the download links in the HTML page and Fitz to extract the data within the PDF. The resulting data is stored in a `.json` file in `data/$DATE`.

## non-PDF extractions (e.g. csvs, xlsx ...)

We use Requests to make HTTP/HTTPS requests to a web API, checking whether the data is up-to-date. We then download the raw files to `data/$date`, via `scripts/age_extraction.py`. This is summarised in `Makefile` in the `make files` directive.

## Dynamic websites

We use webdriver from selenium to find the elements and extract the corresponding data.
